<h1> Human Life Expectancy Exploration and Analysis </h1>
This project seeks to better understand the life expectancy of humans around the world. This project will analyze the factors affecting the life expectancy of a person, see which countries sustain both healthy lifestyles and growth, compare life expectancy between males and females around the world, and develop a model to predict the life expectancy and see how it has been defined based on a given set of parameters.

<h3> Project Questions and Hypotheses </h3>
<h6> Questions: </h6><br>
-What external factors affect life expectancy and which have the greatest affect? <br>
-How has life expectancy changed over time around the world?<br>
-How does life expectancy differ from males to females? <br>
<h6> Hypotheses: </h6> <br>
-Schooling, GDP, low alcohol consumption, low rates of chronic diseases, and increased access to vaccinations against chronic illnesses will have strong positive affects on life expectancy. <br>
-Life expectancy has overall increased as time has increased around the world. <br>
-Females have higher life expectancies than males do in all countries. <br>
